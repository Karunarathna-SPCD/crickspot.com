            <p> <b>Cummins coy on Australia bowling attack and Bazball plans</b></p>

            <p>&nbsp;Can you plan for Bazball? We are about to get a proper idea. The concept has been around for a year now and has had only a couple of blips - one by the narrowest of margins in New Zealand - but newly-crowned world Test champions Australia appear to be the team best equipped to challenge the phenomenon. However, Pat Cummins won't be ripping up the playbook to counter a style that has, well, ripped up the playbook. There is confidence within the Australia camp that the traits that have served them well over the last two years, and in a variety of conditions, especially overseas, will continue to do that in the face of whatever England throws at them.</p>

            <p><b>Russell, Gayle and Shakib among marquee names drafted at GT20</b><br><br>Andre Russell, Chris Gayle, Shakib al Hasan and Mohammad Rizwan are among some of the most prominent players drafted in for the third edition of the Global T20 Canada. The league, which returns for the first time in four seasons, will be played between July 20 and August 6 in Ontario.

The league has gone through something of a revamp since its last edition. Winnipeg Hawks, who won the league last time it was held, no longer take part, while Edmonton Royals are also absent. Their place is taken by Surrey Jaguars and Mississauga Panthers. Each side will include two marquee players and three Canadian players from the national side, as well as three emerging Canadian players, with 25 matches to be played across the 18 days.</p>

          <div class="col-xl-6"><b>Ashwin reviews the review in bizarre incident in TNPL 2023</b><br><br>In a bizarre play, two player reviews were taken off the same ball bowled by R Ashwin during a Tamil Nadu Premier League match between Dindigul Dragons vs Ba11sy Trichy in Coimbatore. After Trichy's R Rajkumar had successfully overturned an on-field caught-behind decision from umpire K Srinivasan in the 13th over, Ashwin signalled for another review of the same.

Ashwin, the Dindigul captain, was seemingly unhappy with the original decision being overturned and had a discussion with both on-field umpires, Srinivasan and MV Saidharshan Kumar. S Nishaanth, the TV umpire, ruled it not out once again.</div>

          <div class="col-xl-6"><b>James Anderson, Ollie Robinson return for Ashes opener; Stuart Broad retained ahead of Mark Wood</b><br><br>Stuart Broad will play alongside James Anderson and Ollie Robinson in England's seam attack at Edgbaston after pipping Mark Wood to the final spot in their XI for Friday's first Ashes Test.

The move comes as a surprise given England's stated desire for "fast, flat wickets" this summer, leaving them without a genuine fast bowler in the side - though Wood is likely to come into the side at some stage in the series.

Ben Stokes, England's captain, has previously signalled his wish to hit Australia with pace, saying earlier this year: "Having the option to have someone who can bowl above 90mph [145kph] is what any captain wants."</div>
